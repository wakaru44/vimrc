# vimrc - My personal .vim folder

Just too lazy to set this up more than once.

It contains my favourite tweaks and plugins for python, ruby, etc

to set up:

    cd ~
    git clone https://github.com/wakaru44/vimrc.git .vim
    bash .vim/setup.sh

and if you don't want the backups, delete them

# But... How does it work?

It doesn't store the vim plugins as submodules, but clones them every time you run the setup.
It will keep you easily updated, and it removes the burden of dealing with submodules.

It gets crazy with submodules.
