# vimrc - My personal .vim folder

Just too lazy to set this up more than once.

It contains my favourite tweaks and plugins for python, ruby, etc

to set up:

    cd ~
    mv .vim vim.backup
    mv .vimrc vim.backup/vimrc
   
    git clone https://github.com/wakaru44/vimrc.git .vim
    cd .vim
    bash -x setup.sh

and if you don't want the backups, delete them
